LESSON 1:
A shell script -- a text file that contains a series of commands
Commands executed one by one
Same as typing each command into the terminal

*nano installation -- sudo apt-get install -y nano
-y : the flag that proceeds with the installation after the download
ctrl+u -- to clear the line of command

nano day1.sh
chmod +x day1.sh
./day1.sh

Nothing special about the file name. Any valid file name is acceptable. Only in certain OSs the '.sh' extension matters.
The files permissions matter. To be an executable.

ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kabilan kabilan  30 Apr 29 17:52 day1.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 kabilan kabilan 491 Apr 29 17:55 Notes

- -- file/directory. It will be d
rwx: 1st set -- admin permissions
     2nd set -- the current group to which the user belongs to
     3rd set -- whoever uses the system
Then owner followed by the group
r and x permissions required to execute the file






LESSON 2:
#! - sharp+bang - shebang
This specifies the interpreter used.
Here execution is done by /bin/bash.
If not specified it is executed by the current shell.

What happens when i do ./
    .  -- current directory
    .. -- parent directory
/home/kabilan/Desktop/Shell_Scripting/day1.sh

echo -- shell builtin
type -- shell builtin

type echo
echo is a shell builtin

type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /usr/bin/echo
echo is /bin/echo

The path of the progra being executed when echo is called.
/usr/bin/echo "Here I am!"

When using builtins we avoid the issue of path being different in different systems. Also the script is portable.

Type of the variable doesn't matter. And mind the space before and after the '=' sign.






LESSON 3:
Rules for naming variables -- the usual
By convention, variable names are all uppercase. Can use mixed case also. Case-sensitive.

Not enclosing the bracket causes the bash to not identify the variable.

Variable reassignment is feasible.

Comments -- #This is a comment
Opening comment recommended. Programming practice. Blank lines to logically group lines of codes.






LESSON 4:
Psudo-code -- comments to for the basic structure of the file.
Refer to all commands from sysinfo.sh






LESSON 5:
File is got-root.sh
Can be used to check if the user is installing a software as root user.
